<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full Privacy Policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to our Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p>To participate in the secure software movement, you may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read or use any OWASP Site without registering an account.</li>
<li>Edit content on OWASP Sites with a Github account.</li>
<li>Register to be a content approver by providing a Github account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we want to understand how OWASP Sites are used so we can make them better for you, we collect some information when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make public contributions.</li>
<li>Use the OWASP Sites.</li>
<li>Send us emails or participate in a survey or give feedback.</li>
<li>Choose to Donate to or become a Member of OWASP.</li>
<li>Attend Conferences or participate in local chapter meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure.</li>
<li>Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as to improve the OWASP Sites, to comply with the law, or to protect you and others.</li>
<li>Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving the OWASP Sites, and our obligations under law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any content you add or any change that you make to a OWASP Site will be publicly and permanently available in addition to being associated with your Github username.</li>
<li>Our community of volunteer editors and contributors is a self-policing body. Certain administrators of the OWASP Sites, who are chosen by the community, use tools that grant them limited access to nonpublic information about recent contributions so they may protect the OWASP Sites and enforce policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our commitment to education and research around the world, we occasionally release public information and aggregated or non-personal information to the general public through data dumps and data sets.</p>
<p>For the protection of the OWASP Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the OWASP Sites.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The OWASP Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates owasp.org and its companion Project, Conference, and event websites.</p>
<p>This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information.</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect very little personal information about you.</li>
<li>We do not rent or sell your information to third parties.</li>
<li>By using OWASP Sites, you consent to this Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OWASP secure software movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the OWASP Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.</p>
<p>We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the OWASP Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the OWASP Sites, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the OWASP Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the OWASP Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.</p>
<p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the OWASP Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the OWASP Sites better for you.</p>
<p>After all, it’s people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the OWASP Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like “tracking pixels” and “cookies” used in the Privacy Policy. Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful.</p>
<p>Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:</p>
<h3 id="when-we-say--we-mean">When we say = we mean</h3>
<ul>
<li>“the OWASP Foundation” / “the Foundation” / “OWASP” / “we” / “us” / “our” = The OWASP Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the OWASP Sites.</li>

<h3 id="what-this-privacy-policy-does--doesnt-cover">What This Privacy Policy Does &amp; Doesn’t Cover</h3>
<p>Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the OWASP Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-what-this-privacy-policy-covers">Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-information-we-receive-from-you--how-we-get-it">Types of Information We Receive From You &amp; How We Get It</h3>
<h4 id="your-public-contributions">Your Public Contributions</h4>
<p>When you make a contribution to any OWASP Site you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your Github username. We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the OWASP Sites are used.</p>
<h4 id="publicly-visible-information">Publicly Visible Information</h4>
<p>Account Information &amp; Registration</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not need to create an account to use any OWASP Site.</li>
<li>If you want to edit content, you must have a GitHub account.</li>
<li>If you want to be a content approver, you must provide an active GitHub account.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a OWASP Site, except under rare circumstances.</p>
<h4 id="gps--other-location-technologies">GPS &amp; Other Location Technologies</h4>
<p>If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy.</p>
<h4 id="metadata">Metadata</h4>
<p>Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the OWASP Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.</p>
<h4 id="ip-addresses">IP Addresses</h4>
<p>Finally, when you visit any OWASP Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.</p>
<h4 id="information-related-to-your-use-of-the-owasp-sites">Information Related to Your Use of the OWASP Sites</h4>
<p>We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use OWASP Sites. Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the OWASP Sites.</p>
<p>We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the OWASP Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.</p>
<p>We want to make the OWASP Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the OWASP Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the OWASP Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community’s values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the OWASP Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.</p>
<h4 id="information-we-receive-automatically">Information We Receive Automatically</h4>
<p>Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the OWASP Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser’s language preference, the type and version of your device’s operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the OWASP Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the OWASP Sites.</p>
<p>Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with OWASP Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the OWASP Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different OWASP Sites, and analyze trends.</p>
<h4 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h4>
<p>We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the OWASP Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.</p>
<p>We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of “locally stored data” technologies, such as cookies and local storage. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.</p>
<p>Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to Personal Information (like your IP address) and information about your use of the OWASP Sites (like your username or the time of your visit).</p>
<p>We use this information to make your experience with the OWASP Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the OWASP Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at <a href="https://owasp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="523b3c343d123d253321227c3d2035">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>
<h4 id="more-on-locally-stored-data">More on Locally Stored Data</h4>
<p>We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.</p>
<p>While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a OWASP Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a OWASP Site.</p>
<h4 id="how-we-use-information-we-receive-from-you">How We Use Information We Receive From You</h4>
<p>We and our service providers use your information for the legitimate purpose of pursuing our charitable mission, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating the OWASP Sites, sharing your contributions and administering our Services.</li>
<li>Providing customized Services.</li>
<li>Sending emails with news updates, surveys and communications about items we believe may be of interest to you.</li>
<li>Sending optional surveys and requesting feedback.</li>
<li>Improving the OWASP Sites and making your user experience safer and better.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="gps--other-location-technologies-1">GPS &amp; Other Location Technologies</h5>
<p>As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the OWASP Sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time, and still use the OWASP Sites.</p>
<h5 id="metadata-1">Metadata</h5>
<p>As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. Please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.</p>
<h4 id="ip-addresses-1">IP Addresses</h4>
<p>When you visit any OWASP Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting OWASP Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.</p>
<p>We use this location information to make your experience with the OWASP Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the OWASP Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support OWASP communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled “For Legal Reasons” and “To Protect You, Ourselves &amp; Others.”</p>
<h3 id="when-may-we-share-your-information">When May We Share Your Information?</h3>
<p>With Your Permission</p>
<ul>
<li>We may share your information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.</li>
<li>We share your information for a particular purpose, if you agree.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="for-legal-reasons">For Legal Reasons</h4>
<p>We will disclose your information in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. We will notify you of such requests when possible.</p>
<p>We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user’s information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party’s request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.</p>
<h4 id="if-the-organization-is-transferred-really-unlikely">If the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!)</h4>
<p>In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days’ notice before any personal information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the OWASP Sites and a notification at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<h4 id="to-protect-you-ourselves--others">To Protect You, Ourselves &amp; Others</h4>
<p>We, or users with certain administrative rights, may disclose information that is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enforce or investigate potential violations of the OWASP Foundation or community-based policies;</li>
<li>protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or</li>
<li>prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.</li>
</ul>
<p>We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, may need to share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any OWASP Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.</p>
<p>OWASP Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the OWASP Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to Nonpublic Information Policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the OWASP Foundation.</p>
<p>We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it’s reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns.</p>
<h4 id="to-our-service-providers">To Our Service Providers</h4>
<p>As hard as we may try, we can’t do it all. So sometimes we use third-party service providers or contractors who help run or improve the OWASP Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. Our primary service providers, who may change without prior notice include, GitHub, SalesForce, Atlassian, Expensify, RegOnline, Eventbrite, Paypal, and Stripe.</p>
<p>Many OWASP Sites are served through GitHub Pages offered by GitHub, Inc. The OWASP Foundation is a customer of GitHub and as such, they are a Service Provider to us. There are other policies that may pertain to you and your use of GitHub. Please visit their privacy policy for more details.</p>
<p>If you are visiting OWASP Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.</p>
<h4 id="to-understand--experiment">To Understand &amp; Experiment</h4>
<p>We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the OWASP Sites. We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the OWASP Sites. When we share information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your information consistent with this Policy.
The software that powers much of the functionality of OWASP Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users’ needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the OWASP Sites.</p>
<p>Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the OWASP Sites. Sharing this information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the OWASP Sites.</p>
<p>When we give access to personal information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your personal information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects.</p>
<h4 id="because-you-made-it-public">Because You Made It Public</h4>
<p>Any information you post publicly on the OWASP Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on any page, that is public, and not protected by this Policy. Please think carefully about your desired level of anonymity before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-protect-your-data">How Do We Protect Your Data?</h3>
<p>We strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we can’t guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).</p>
<p>We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to <a href="https://owasp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e1888f878ea18e96809291cf8e9386">[email&#160;protected]</a>, so we can investigate the source of the email.</p>
<h4 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-data">How Long Do We Keep Your Data?</h4>
<p>Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the OWASP Sites or to comply with U.S. law.</p>
<p>Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the OWASP Sites, and our obligations under applicable U.S. law. Non-personal information may be retained indefinitely.</p>
<p>Please remember that certain information, such as your IP address (if you edit while not logged in) and any public contributions to the OWASP Sites, is archived and displayed indefinitely by design; the transparency of the projects’ contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="important-info">Important info</h2>
<p>For the protection of the OWASP Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the OWASP Sites.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-the-foundation--what-does-that-mean-for-me">Where is the Foundation &amp; What Does That Mean for Me?</h3>
<p>The OWASP Foundation is a non-profit organization with its legal headquarters in Maryland, USA, with content and data hosted on sites around the world. If you decide to use OWASP Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.</p>
<p>Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:</p>
<p>In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the OWASP Sites, and via a notification on OWASP mailing lists.</p>
<p>For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days’ prior notice via a notification on OWASP mailing lists.</p>
<p>We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the OWASP Sites after this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part. Your continued use of the OWASP Sites after any subsequent version of this Privacy Policy becomes effective, following notice as outlined above, constitutes acceptance of that version of the Privacy Policy on your part.</p>
<h3 id="contact-us">Contact Us</h3>
<p>If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or the information collected under this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="https://owasp.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4b22252d240b243c2a383b6524392c">[email&#160;protected]</a> or contact us directly.</p>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you also may have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority competent for your country or region.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading our Privacy Policy. We hope you enjoy using the OWASP Sites and appreciate your participation in creating, maintaining, and constantly working to improve the largest repository of free security-related knowledge in the world.</p>
